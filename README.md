# Passive-Learning
Passive learning, also known as batch learning, is a method of acquiring data by processing a large set of pre-labeled data. In passive learning, the algorithm uses all the available data to learn and improve its performance. The algorithm does not interact with the user or request additional data to improve its accuracy.
